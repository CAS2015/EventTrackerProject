  <h3 class="tagline">Smart labels for moving and storing</h3>
  <p class="websiteDescription">Gone are the days where a user must rifle through boxes in an attic to try and find a specific item or where a user must try to take meticulous notes when moving. These labels have QR codes that can be printed and placed on the box in addition to the normal label content. The QR code connects the box to a database where the user can take pictures of the contents of the box as well as take notes as to what's inside the box, what room the contents go to, and whether it is fragile or not.</p>
